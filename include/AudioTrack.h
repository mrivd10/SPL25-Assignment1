/**
 * Base class for all audio track types in the DJ library system.
 * This class demonstrates virtual functions, Rule of 5, and dynamic memory management.
 * 
 * Phase 4 contracts:
 * - load(): lightweight, format-specific preparation when a track is assigned to a deck;
 *   sets readiness state and may log; does not start playback.
 * - analyze_beatgrid(): runs immediately after load() in this assignment to make BPM
 *   available for compatibility checks; results may be cached per instance.
 * - clone(): used at the cache→mixer boundary; mixer always receives a polymorphic clone
 *   and owns it; the cache retains its own copy.
